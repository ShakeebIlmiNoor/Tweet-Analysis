# Tweet-Analysis

In this project, we are using the language Python for Data exploration and analysis. We have been given a dataset of Twitter handles and text messages alongwith other info.

The first part of studying the dataset is Exploratory Data Analysis. We do so by cleaning the dataset by using appropriate means. Then we draw various charts and perform Univariate and Bivariate analysis to recognise the patterns between different columns of the dataset.

The next part is splitting the dataset into traing and testing parts and applying different ML algorithms to predict certain values.

We have also written the most basic form of Logistic Regression algorithm using the sigmoid function from scratch.

At the end, we ask three questions from the dataset and try to find their answers using python libraries.
